# Landing-Page
This landing page was a project that I completed via the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

# Goal
1. Create a landing page template for the proided design: located at ./design-references/Final-Design.png with specific fonts and colors specified at ./design-references/Fonts-colors.png 
    - Use comments to indicate where images can be placed when using the template.
    - Ensure that when a user adds their own images to the template, the landing page apperance does not change, and image  properties are already specificed in CSS. 
2. Customize the final landing page for a fake client. 

# Process
-Write the Content in HTML, create an organized, logical, easy-to-read structure for CSS. 
-Use comments to indicate where images can be played into the HTML for the potential user.
