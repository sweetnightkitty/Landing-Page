# Landing-Page
This landing page was a project that I completed via the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page on August 18, 2023.

# Goal
* Create a landing page template for the proided design: located at ./design-references/Final-Design.png with specific fonts and colors specified at ./design-references/Fonts-colors.png 

* Since the provided design was only a photo, the aim of this project was to create a Landing Page that looked as visually close to the original image as possible without exact measurements.

* Utilize HTML, CSS and Flexbox to create the landing page.
